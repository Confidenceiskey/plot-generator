### [Star Wars Plot Generator](https://confidenceiskey.github.io/plot-generator/)

_A web app that generates a Star Wars Plot (title & description) for you_

#### Project Guidelines

The aim for this project was to build a web app that used the SWAPI API to allow the user the choice to add who (or what) they wanted in a plot. The full design and UI was up to me to create.  
To complete the project, the below **user stories** needed to be fulfilled:
- I'm able to select at least two resources
- I'm able to search for a particular resource
- A random resource can be generated automatically for me
- A plot title, description and resource list is generated for me
